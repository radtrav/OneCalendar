#  Calendar App
  Hello! ðŸ‘‹


## About
The app allows users to create appointments for any date and see already created events for the currently active month.
  
## Todo list
  - [x] Create a calendar grid for the given month and year. Make sure that every month starts from the appropriate day of the week.
  - [x] Add a feature that allows users to switch month and year
  - [x] Add highlighting for today's date
  - [x] Add a feature that allows users to create an event.
      - When users click on the day, they should see a "create event" form (e.g. popup) that includes Hour, Minutes, and Event Name fields
      - After users fill in the form, the event data should be saved somewhere on the client side.
  - [x] In the bottom of the calendar, show a list of events for the currently active month only.
      - Events should be sorted by date/time
      - Events should have the following format: "{Day} {Month} {Year} {HH}:{MM} - {EventName}"
  - [x] Make it look right on mobile devices
  - [x] Make a design change to improve the user experience and/or style it according to OneClass design
